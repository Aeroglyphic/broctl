Shell

   - Unify argument handling for shell's commmands

Bro config

   - Make sessions IDs shorter

Known bugs:

   - We sometimes don't get the return events for
   Broccoli-communication. Not sure where the problem is.

   - Proxy reports wrong number of peer with "status" if multiple
   worker sare running on the same box.

   - bin/helpers/* should be more robust against unexpected output.
