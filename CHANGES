- Moving BroControl to its own git repository.

- Converting README to reST format.

- Renamed "Capstats" config option to "CapstatsPath".

- Merge with Subversion repository as of r7098. Incorporated changes:

  o Increasing default timeouts for scan detector significantly.

  o Increasing the manager's max_remote_events_processed to
    something large, as it would slow down the process too much
    otherwise and there's no other work to be interleaved with it
    anyway.

  o Adding debug output to cluster's part of catch-and-release
    (extends the debugging already present in policy/debug.bro)

  o Fixing typo in util.py. Closes #223.

  o Added note to README pointing to HTML version.

  o Disabling print_hook for proxies' remote.log.

  o broctl's capstats now reports a total as well, and stats.log
    tracks these totals. Closes #160.

  o Avoiding spurious "waiting for lock" messages in cron mode.
    Closes #206.

  o Bug fixes for installation on NFS.

  o Bug fix for top command on FreeBSD 8.

  o crash-diag now checks whether gdb is available.

  o trace-summary reports the sample factor in use in its output,
    and now also applies it to the top-local-networks output (not
    doing the latter was a bug).

  o Removed the default twice-a-day rotation for conn.log. The
    default rotation for conn.log now is now once every 24h, just
    like for all other logs with the exception of mail.log (which is
    still rotated twice a day, and thus the alarms are still mailed
    out twice a day).

  o Fixed the problem of logs sometimes being filed into the wrong
    directory (see the (now gone) FAQ entry in the README).

  o One can now customize the archive naming scheme. See the
    corresponding FAQ entry in the README.

  o Cleaned up, and extended, collection of cluster statistics.

    ${logdir}/stats now looks like this:

      drwxr-xr-x   4 bro  wheel      59392 Apr  5 17:55 .
      drwxr-xr-x  96 bro  wheel       2560 Apr  6 12:00 ..
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel        576 Apr  6 16:40 meta.dat
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:40 profiling
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel  771834825 Apr  6 16:40 stats.log
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:25 www

    stats.log accumulates cluster statistics collected every time
    "cron" is called.

    - profiling/ keeps the nodes' prof.logs.

    - www/ keeps a subset of stats.log in CSV format for easy plotting.

    - meta.dat contains meta information about the current cluster
    state (in particular which nodes we have, and when the last
    stats update was done).

    Note that there is not Web setup yet to actually plot the data
    in www/.

  o BroControl now automatically maintains links inside today's log
    archive directory pointing to the current live version of the
    corresponding log file (if Bro is running). For example:

    smtp.log.11:52:18-current -> /usr/local/cluster/spool/manager/smtp.log

  o Alarms mailed out by BroControl now (1) have the notice msg in the
    subject; and (2) come with the full mail.log entry in the body.
