# the node crashed, wait for this node's archive-log processes to finish,
# archive any remaining unrotated logs (if bro crashed or was killed), and

# If <crashflag> is "crash", then BroControl has determined that Bro crashed
# and this script will return information about the crash on stdout which is
# suitable for mailing to the user.  If <crashflag> is "killed", then
# BroControl terminated Bro forcefully (but intentionally) by SIGKILL while
# trying to stop Bro.
