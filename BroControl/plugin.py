class Plugin(object):
    """The class ``Plugin`` is the base class for all BroControl plugins.

    The class has a number of methods for plugins to override, and every
    plugin must at least override ``name()`` and ``pluginVersion()``.

    For each BroControl command ``foo``, there are two methods,
    ``cmd_foo_pre`` and ``cmd_foo_post``, that are called just before the
    command is executed and just after it has finished, respectively. The
    arguments these methods receive correspond to their command-line
    parameters, and are further documented below.

    The ``cmd_<XXX>_pre`` methods have the ability to prevent the command's
    execution, either completely or partially for those commands that take
    nodes as parameters. In the latter case, the method receives a list of
    nodes that the command is to be run on, and it can filter that list and
    returns modified version of nodes to actually use. The standard case would
    be returning simply the unmodified ``nodes`` parameter. To completely
    block the command's execution, return an empty list. To just not execute
    the command for a subset, remove the affected ones.  For commands that do
    not receive nodes as arguments, the return value is interpreted as boolean
    indicating whether command execution should proceed (True) or not (False).

    The ``cmd_<XXX>_post`` methods likewise receive the commands arguments as
    their parameter, as documented below. For commands taking nodes, the list
    corresponds to those nodes for which the command was actually executed
    (i.e., after any ``cmd_<XXX>_pre`` filtering).

    Note that if a plugin prevents a command from executing either completely or
    partially, it should report its reason via the ``message()`` or
    ``error()`` methods.

    If multiple plugins hook into the same command, all their
    ``cmd_<XXX>_{pre,post}`` are executed in undefined order. The command is
    executed on the intersection of all ``cmd_<XXX>_pre`` results.

    Finally, note that the ``restart`` command is just a combination of other
    commands and thus their callbacks are run in addition to the callbacks
    for ``restart``.
